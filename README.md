Benchmarking nearest neighbors on Knowledge Graph Embedding models
==================================================================

This project is a branch of the [ANN Benchmarking framework](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) that has been adapted to run experiments with Knowledge-Graph-Embedding-based datasets.

We added the option `--use-bayesian-optimizer`. If it is used, the parameters of the evaluated ANN system are set based on the integrated bayesian optimization.
